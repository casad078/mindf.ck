            <p>THE MIND IS AN ASSHOLE. It eats up images, regurgitates them, and spits them back out. A lot of the time, the images we see aren’t, well, really there. But the spit-up—the benign dumbassery that is our mind—makes it look like something, which is the whole point of MINDF*CK. It isn’t about vision. It’s about the ways the mind reshapes itself to make sense of the senseless. It’s about inkblots on a psychologist’s test paper and the way we press our own secrets into their ambiguous forms. It’s about the artist who splashes paint on canvas to uncover something raw and unreal, knowing that viewers will find a thousand different meanings in the same set of strokes. It’s about image, emotional storage, and regurgitation. In that twisting, distorted space between what’s real and what’s imagined lies the mystery of perception. Do we see what we expect to see? Or do we, in each moment, create something new? As we dive into the minds of artists, psychologists, and ordinary dreamers, we may find that the simplest images hide the most complex truths. How do we perceive images? Why do we see them that way? What makes us tick? All great questions for science and psychology nerds like MM Labs. MIND MATTERS is a diagnostic lab and clinic that is all about imaging the brain—or more so, imaging the imaging of the brain. This is a collection of research, trials, examples, and interactive systems that help us understand the vastness of our brains. It’s like our own science textbook.            </p>

            <h6>&lt;HOW THE MIND&gt;
              <br>
              &lt;PERCIEVES&gt;
              <br></h6>
             <p> Conceptually, neurons in low level brain regions extract basic features such as line orientation, depth and the color of localimage elements. They send the information to several mid-level brain areas. Neurons in these areas code for other features, such as motion direction, color and shape fragmnts. Neurons in mid-level areas send the information to yet higher levels for an even more abstract analysis of the visual scene. Neurons at these higher levels code for the category of objects and even for the identity of specific individuals. Hence, every visual object activates a complex repre-sentation that is carried by a large set of neurons across many brain regions. 
		In cognitive psychology, however, perception is 
defined as the cognitive activity through which humans become aware of their environment, receive, and interpret the information 
around them (Eysenck & Keane, 2015; Goldstein, 2014). Perception can refer to time, space, or quantities, but it also encompasses the use of our senses, such as visual, auditory, olfactory, haptic, etc. It is through perception that we can recognise objects, distinguish shapes, colours, and sounds — in other words, apprehend and understand our world. In this article, our focus will be on visual perception. 
When information is fed into the brain, we are able to make quick conections to information already stored in our memory. With these associations, we anchor concepts in our brain. Finding concepts - that’s what our brain deals with all day. It tries to understand what we see. And that is quite demanding. Our brain has to do a lot of guesswork. Why is that? We move in a three-dimensional world. However, the light only falls on our retina in two dimensions. The step from two to three dimensions keeps our brain on its toes. To create our vision of reality,the brain’s work depends on intrinsic factors (i.e., internal to the individual) such as our knowledge, level of alertness, emotional state, and motivations. Some studies, for example, have shown that a person in a good mood tends to perceive others’ faces as friendlier or more pleasant (Bower & Forgas, 2000; Pessoa, 2009). Others have also reported effects of anxiety and stress, making individuals more likely to detect or overestimate threat signals in the environment (Bishop, 2009; Mogg & Bradley, 1999).

            <h6>&lt;HOW DO THESE&gt; <br>
            &lt;PERCEPTIONS VARY?&gt;</h6>
            <p>The process of visual perception is a best guess scenario. When 
              we look at something, the brain uses visual cues – sensory 
              signals that convey information – to help work out what that thing 
              is. This means that our perception of the world is not a simple 
              reflection of sensory information, it is an interpretation of it. Perceptions are influenced by our emotions, our cultural training, our personal values,and our formal background.Interindividual diffe-rences in perception describes the effect that differences in brain structureor factors such as culture, upbringing and environmenthave on the perception of humans. Interindividual (differing from person to person) variability is usually regarded as a source of noise for research. The brain interprets signals that the world sends it and tries to create the most stable and coherent representation of reality. In the case of bistable images, the brain will try to “reduce ambiguity” to achieve a certain stability and coherence. We all assume everyone perceives the world as we do, even if their impressions might be different from ours. It is difficult to imagine that some people might perceive 
              three-dimensional depth differently from ourselves. Put simply, things like upbringing, personality, environment, nature, brain formation and a whole bunch of other shit makes us see things
               a certain way, and makes the things we see different from person  to person. It’s like the blue-black/white-gold dress all over again.
