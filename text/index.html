      <summary>BRAIN BIAS</summary>
      <p>
        The brain relies on shortcuts all the time. We use what we’ve learned from our environment to make quick assumptions about whom to trust, how to behave, what to say.But shortcuts can sometimes 
        lead us astray.You can’t always trust your brain.</p>
        <h6>&lt;WE'VE GOT&gt;<br>
        &lt;MINDBUGS&gt;<br></h6>
        <p>
          Our eyes play tricks on us. Our minds fill in the gaps of what 
we think we see. But is that actually what’s there? These visual illusions work because the surrounding context of an image shapes what we see. Context is so powerful because it sets up our expectations of what we might see. And oncewe have that expectation, we can’t see it any other way!
        </p>
        <h6>&lt;FAMILIARITY&gt;<br>
          &lt;SIMILARITY&gt;<br>
          &lt;BELONGING&gt;<br></h6>
          <p>
            Babies quickly learn to prefer people from familiar groups. A baby might prefer a face that matches the gender or race of their 
primary caregiver. At just a few hours old, newborn infants already 
prefer listening to a language that they heard in the womb over a
unfamiliar language.
		Toddlers notice similarities and differences across groups defined by language, gender, or race, and they start to more clearly separate people along these dimensions.The adults around them fill in “value gaps” by subtly communicating about the kinds of people that are safe or smart. This teaches children whom they should approach and avoid. With further learning, children figure out who they are in the world. They learn the meaning of their own race, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, religion, and more.As a result,  they also come to feel belonging, preferring their in-groups (“us”),and perhaps expressing negative attitudes toward out-groups (“them”).
          </p>
          <h6>&lt;CONFIRMING&gt;<br></h6>
          <p>The process of building and maintaining bias continues into adulthood. Throughout our lives, we use confirmation bias to see 
            only what we expect to see in our environment.We take in only 
            the examples that align with our preexisting notions and stereo-types. We discard the counter-examples that would challenge 
            these world views.</p>
          <h5>“IMPLICIT BIAS IS LIKE THE SMOG THAT HANGS OVER A COMMUNITY. IT BECOMES THE AIR PEOPLE BREATHE.”</h5>
          <p>What about my brain? Is there bias there too? The amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex make up the control panel for bias.The amygdala fires up for our fear, the hippocampus records  our memories, and the prefrontal cortex controls our ability to reason and reconsider.</p>
          <h6>&lt;WHAT ABOUT IMAGING?&gt;</h6>
          <p>PERCEPTION IS BASED ON OUR BRAIN DATA. The images we have stored already do must of the heavy lifting when looking at new images,  so it’s clear that whatever conditions you grew up with and around  make up all of your stored imaging. You pick a new image, and sort through the cabinet to find somehthing you already know that’s similar, and so bias gets pushed onto the conception of the new  image you’re looking at. Funky.</p>

          <summary class="second">ON COLORS</summary>
          <p>We see color thanks to photoreceptor cells in the retinas of our eyes that transmit signals to our brains. Highly sensitive rods allow us to see at very low light levels – but in shades of gray. To see color, we need brighter light and cone cells within our eyes that respond to roughly three different wavelengths:</p>
          <ul class="math">
            <li>
              &lt;1 * Short (S) – blue spectrum&gt;<br>
              &lt;(absorption peak ≈ 445 nm)&gt;
            </li>
            <li>
              &lt;2 * Medium (M) – green spectrum&gt;<br>
              &lt;(absorption peak ≈ 535 nm)&gt;
              </li>
              <li>
              &lt;3 * Long (L) – red spectrum&gt;<br>
              &lt;(absorption peak ≈ 565 nm)&gt;
              </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Perception of color depends on how an object absorbs and reflects wavelengths. Human beings can only see a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, from about 400 nm to 700 nm, but it’s enough to allow us to see millions of colors.
            This is the basis of trichromatic theory, also called Young-Helmholtz after the researchers who developed it. It was only confirmed in the 1960s, which means this level of detail in understanding wavelengths and colors is only 60 years old.
            Meanwhile, opponent process theory postulates that how we see color  depends on three receptor complexes with opposite actions: light/dark (or white/black), red/green, and blue/yellow.Together, the two theories help describe the complexity of human color perception.</p>
            <h6>&lt;HOW OUR SURROUNDINGS IMPACT&gt;<br>
              &lt;COLOR PERCEPTION &gt;<br></h6>
              <p>Most of us can recognize the color of familiar objects, even as lighting circumstances change (such as a yellow school bus). This adaptation of the eye and brain is known as color constancy. It doesn’t apply to subtle color variations, though, or counteract the changes in color due to the intensity or quality of light.We might also be able to agree with each other on the wavelengths that define basic colors. However, this might have more to do with our brains than our eyes.
                For instance, in a 2005 study at the University of Rochester, individuals tended to perceive colors the same way, even though the number of cones in their retinas varied widely. When volunteers were asked to tune a disk into what they’d describe as “pure yellow” light, everyone selected nearly the same wavelength.
                But things get much more complicated when individuals 
            or multiple people try to match colors to a product or material samples. Physical or environmental factors and personal differences between viewers can alter our perception of color. These factors include:
            </p>
            <ul class="math">
              &lt;1 * Physical: light source, background,&gt;<br>
              &lt;altitude, noise&gt;
            </li>
            <li>
              &lt;2 * Personal: age, medications, memory,&gt;<br>
              &lt;mood.&gt;
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your job depends on achieving the right color again and again, relying on human eyesight alone won’t work. That’s because there are factors beyond our control that dictate how we see color. Not only that, when you’re working with people in different offices – whether they’re across the country or around the world – these factors greatly increase the risk of color variances.To complicate matters further, the phenomenon of impossible colors, chimerical colors and more exist and can wreak havoc on a business that relies heavily on accurate color readings. Using instruments to accurately detect colors from samples and products is imperative and having inter- instrument agreement is even more so.</p>
            <h6>&lt;THE FIRST STEP&gt;<br></h6>
            <p>Controlling colors despite unavoidable diff-erences in human perception of color starts with awareness and education. It’s true that our eyes can only get us so far. Thankfully, there is a range of tools available to ensure the colors of your products are always accurate. Datacolor offers a complete line of spectrophotometers, software and other solutions suitable for a variety of industries —including plastics, textiles, coatings and retail paint. We also designed an instrument specifically to measure materials that a traditional spectrophotometer cannot measure.</p>

        <summary>PAREDOLIA</summary>
        <p>Pareidolia is a phenomenon wherein people perceive likenesses on random images—such as faces, animals, or objects on clouds and rock formations. It is not a clinical diagnosis nor is it a disorder.  The brain has a tendency to assign meaning wherever it can. Seeing a rabbit in the clouds, or an animal (instead of leaves) in the brush is a commonplace experience of pareidolia.
          Well-known examples of pareidolia include the image of Jesus on burnt toast, the man on the moon, and a Cheetos corn snack that looked like the gorilla Harambe—the latter sold on eBay for $99,900. The brain has an inclination to recognize patterns 
      and apply meaning to what it sees. The fusiform gyrus in the temporal lobe of the cortex activates to process facial recognition. In addition, the tendency for this recognition is an evolutionary by product; ancient man was better off recognizing if a face was a familiar friend or an unfamiliar foe.</p>
      <h6>&lt;IS CONFIRMATION BIAS&gt;<br>
        &lt;INVOLVED IN PAREIDOLIA?&gt;<br></h6>
        <p>Confirmation bias may have some influence on how we perceive. We see what we want and expect to see. Also, if we are looking out for meaningful patterns, we are likely to see them. Confirmation bias can significantly influence the way we perceive the world around us. It shapes our perceptions by leading us to see what we want or expect to see, often reinforcing our existing beliefs. Additionally, when we actively seek meaningful patterns in our surroundings, our tendency to identify them increases, even if they are coincidental or not truly present. This highlights how our expectations and biases can shape our interpretation of reality.</p>
        <h6>&lt;CAN PAREIDOLIA ENHANCE&gt;<br>
          &lt;IMAGINATION AND CREATIVITY?&gt;<br></h6>
          <p>One could argue that great artists like Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso may have engaged in pareidolia. And it may well be that people who frequently experience pareidolia are more creative. How the artist perceives the world is important in their creative process. One could argue that renowned artists like Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso may have engaged in pareidolia—the tendency to see patterns or meaningful images in random stimuli. It's also possible that individuals who frequently experience pareidolia possess heightened creativity, as this ability to perceive connections where others might not can fuel artistic expression. The way an artist perceives the world plays a crucial role in their creative process, shaping how they interpret and represent their surroundings.</p>
